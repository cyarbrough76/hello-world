learning about the github process
I simply wish to propose some changes to your semi-functional ssg content. The things I submit will be functional at least for the target OS. Anything outside of that is also outside my interest. Keep it simple and integrate things that work and perhaps the content might actually grow closer to being complete before you overhaul the underlying code again and render everyones work obsolete.
